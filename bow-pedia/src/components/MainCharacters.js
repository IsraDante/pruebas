    description:
      "Link (リンク Rinku) is the main protagonist of the Legend of Zelda series. He is the everlasting hero of the setting, having appeared throughout the ages in a never-ending line of incarnations. The various heroes who use the name Link are courageous young boys or teenagers, often in green clothing, who leave their homes to save the world from evil forces threatening it.",
    common_locations: "Hyrule kingdom",
    personality:
      "A peculiarity of Link, as well as other characters, is the several different incarnations of the person throughout the Legend of Zelda series. He is implied to be somewhat sleepy or lazy at first since at some point near the beginning of every game except the first two, Majora's Mask, Oracle games, Four Swords, Four Swords Adventures, Twilight Princess and Tri Force Heroes, he is sleeping or dozing off. Since Link is not usually shown to speak, his personality is mainly determined by his actions or others' comments about him. Miyamoto has revealed that if Link were to speak it would ruin immersion and that he wants people to feel as if they are Link. Currently only one incarnation of Link was ever shown to speak and it was the Hero's Shade; the regretful Hero of Time.",

      "Zelda, Princess of Hyrule, best known simply as Princess Zelda (ゼルダ姫 Zeruda) is the name for several female Hylians, usually members of the Royal Family of Hyrule, who often play an integral role in the series. Though each is the titular character of the Legend of Zelda series, the actual protagonist is each era's respective Link.",
    common_locations: "Hyrule kingdom",
    personality:
      "Since most of the Zeldas that appear in the games are different incarnations, they each have slightly differing personalities. However, each Zelda is depicted as a kind and benevolent person. As the holder of the Triforce of Wisdom, she is wise beyond her years and intelligent enough to rule her people. She always wishes to do what is right for others and is extremely self-sacrificing. Though not always capable of defending herself or others on her own, she does not quit and tries to aid allies when she needs their help. She is also forgiving towards former enemies even when they have harmed her in someway. She is however, extremely loyal towards the ones she cares for (such as Link) and does not tolerate them getting harmed.",

Purah is a Sheikah ancient technology researcher who can be found in the Hateno Ancient Tech Lab of Hateno Village in the East Necluda region.

    personality:
      "Purah describes herself as the type who charges ahead when inspired, while her sister prefers to wait patiently. However, Purah thinks her sister is wound up way too tight and waits too much, implying that Purah herself is too impatient. She gets frustrated waiting a century for Link to wake up, unlike her younger sister who waited patiently and even started a family during that time. This resulted in her sister gaining a granddaughter, Paya, showing that Impa used her time waiting wisely. Meanwhile, Purah remained single-minded, focusing entirely on her research and missing out on being a mother and grandmother. This shows that when she is inspired, she charges ahead, causing her to miss out on things. This also may be another reason behind her anti-aging research, as it would allow her to relive her lost youth.",

    description:
      "Revali (リーバル Rībaru?) is a character in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He is a member of the Rito tribe and a major character. Revali is also the Rito Champion and one of Link's allies, though he has an apparent rivalry with the Hylian. He wears the same blue cloth as Daruk, Urbosa and Mipha, symbolizing him being a fellow champion. This blue cloth is similar to the blue shirts worn by Link and Zelda.",
    personality:
      "Revali is very prideful and arrogant, believing himself to be superior to Link in every way, to the point he enviously thought he should be the Hero and not Link. He also comes across as rather flamboyant and over dramatic in his speeches, though he means well. Revali uses his confident exterior to hide his insecurity about himself. Like the other Champions, Revali is also completely devoted to his goal of stopping Calamity Ganon, his sense of duty superseding his vanity that despite his feelings, he sets aside in light of the bigger picture.",

      "King Rhoam Bosphoramus Hyrule, or King Rhoam for short, is a character from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He is the the last King of Hyrule, the husband of the Queen of Hyrule, and the father of Princess Zelda.",
    personality:
      "Rhoam has a similar personality as the other kings of the Royal Family of Hyrule. Being the ruler of Hyrule, Rhoam considers what is best for his land. He is also shown to be very patient, waiting 100 years for Link to awaken from the Shrine of Resurrection. Though shown to be a patient figure, Rhoam`s wisdom is somewhat questionable, at least when compared to his daughter. Although he meant well, Rhoam`s attempts to help Zelda awaken her powers only served to cause her further grief, straining their relationship. Aside from constantly ordering Zelda to train, he would scold her whenever she studied ancient technology, even outright telling her to not do so. This is however, largely due to a sense of urgency (brought on by the knowledge of Ganon's return), rather than a form of unfairness. In truth, Rhoam did feel a sense of regret for treating his daughter in such a manner, as well as misunderstanding her pain from losing her mother.",

He ravaged Hyrule before being sealed away by the Hero wielding the blade that seals darkness, and by the princess with divine powers, with the help of Sheikah clan technology: an army of autonomous Guardians and four Divine Beasts that are commanded by four Champions.

    personality:
      "In general, Ganon was the embodiment of evil, and as such had several negative personality traits such as arrogance, hatred, and rage. In most of his appearances, he is usually reduced to being a primal beast in mindset, either due to a botched resurrection (in the case of the Oracle games and to a lesser extent his Calamity Ganon form in Breath of the Wild), or due to undergoing a massive surge of power or forced transformation that reduces his more calculating aspect to his personality (as was the case in Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, and his Dark Beast Ganon form in Breath of the Wild.)",
